# Inaugural project

This project investigates the effect of tax and wages on the optimal level of consumption and leisure. We find, given our model that both consumption and leisure are increasing in the wage. Further we investigate how the parameters affect the tax revenue of the government, where it can be seen that a lower elasticity of labor supply gives a higher tax revenue. In the final section of the project we investigate what the optimal cut off for the top tax is, along with the optimal buttom and top tax rates.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
