# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Population growth in Denmark** and is about how the population in Denmark developed over a period from 2008 to 2019. Where it is seen that the population in Denmark grew with around 300.000 people in the period. This growth is mainly due to the fact that more children were born compared to elderly people dying and the fact that more people immigrated compared to migrated over the period. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

1. FOLK1A
2. FODIE
