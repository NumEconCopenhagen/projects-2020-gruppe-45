# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Cournot model** and is about how firms compete on quantaties. 
Where we find that by introducing a third firm to the model, the quantity and profit of the firms decrease.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
